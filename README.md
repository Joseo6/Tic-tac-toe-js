# Tic-tac-toe-js
Just a Tic-tac-toe game in which you have to choose de difficulty.
If you want to start a game just click on "Iniciar" button.
There are two difficulties: f√°cil=easy and dificil=hard.
On easy mode you play against a random selector but on hard mode you'll play against an "IA". This "IA" has tree options:
  - First: try to win. Will check if the "IA" can win. If it can, it will.
  - Second: avoid to loose. If the "IA" cannot win, the code will check if it can loose. If it can loose it will avoid loosing.
  - Third: none of the above happens. It will put it's mark at some random cell.
There is a method called "evitarDobletes" which is a bit long for a method but I don't know how to make it sorter. This method avoids the player for getting a double win situation.
The third button "Instrucciones del juego" is just for showing (in Spanish) how to play.

I hope you enjoy the game (if you play it). Also, my first language isn't English, so if there are some mistakes on my spelling or grammar don't doubt about telling me and I'll try to fix it. If you have some doubts about how the code works, speak to me and I'll try to explain it the best I could.
